## Web Design
### Converting Design to HTML / CSS

1. Use `[cmd]`+`[option]`+`=` and `[cmd]`+`[option]`+`-` to zoom in and zoom out on the Mac.  Use `[cmd]`+`[shift]`+`4` (mac screenshot tool) to measure pixel distances between elements, padding, etc.  Or download this ruler https://apps.apple.com/us/app/free-ruler/id1483172210?mt=12.  WARNING: make sure XD zoom is set to 100%
2. Note you can use the code view and click on elements to see some pixel distances in the XD as well.  See image below.
