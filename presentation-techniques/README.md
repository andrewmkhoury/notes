# How to Give Presentations
Notes from training "How to be an Effective Presenter" by Larry Jordan

Make sure you are clearly audible - If it is an online presentation make sure you use a high end headset / mic and adjust and test audio properly.  Statistics have shown that users drop off of presentations and videos if the audio quality isn't good - moreso than anything else.

## Intro
* Never aplogize
* Don't tell jokes - it is hard to land jokes
* Start with enthusiasm - use a dramatic statement or a challenging question.
* Cater the content to the audience - shoot for getting them to say "yes"

## Movement
* Don't pace unless it goes along to emphasize
* Don't hold onto the podium
* Don't flap your hands around your waist
* The less you move the more powerful it is when you do.


## Considerations for Images

* 180 degree rule for photo and video - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule - this esp. applies to live and/or video interviews
