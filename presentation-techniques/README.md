# How to Give Presentations
Notes from training "How to be an Effective Presenter" by Larry Jordan

Make sure you are clearly audible - If it is an online presentation make sure you use a high end headset / mic and adjust and test audio properly.  Statistics have shown that users drop off of presentations and videos if the audio quality isn't good - moreso than anything else.

Grab the attention of the audience and keep it throughout.

## Intro
* Never aplogize - for being nervous, etc.
* Don't tell jokes - it is hard to land jokes
* Start with enthusiasm - use a dramatic statement or a challenging question.
* Cater the content to the audience - shoot for getting them to agree, nod, and say "yes"

## Movement
* Don't pace unless it goes along to emphasize
* Don't hold onto the podium
* Don't flap your hands around your waist
* The less you move the more powerful it is when you do.


## Considerations for Images
* Rule of thirds - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds
* Composition - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(visual_arts)
* 180 degree rule for photo and video - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule - this esp. applies to live and/or video interviews
* If you are trying to convey emotion then use close-up frame of the person's face
* Don't center objects in frame
* Use movement vs. still - for example a horse running vs. horse standing.
* Dramatic close-up images vs. far images that look still - for example a close-up frame of a T-Rex dinosaur toy looks more real and terrifying than a far image of the toy.

> There are several reasons why you might not want to center the subject in a photograph: 
> * Negative space - The larger non-subject area, often the background, is called negative space. Placing the subject off-center creates space for the viewer's eye to be guided into the image.
> * Static images - Placing subjects in the center of the frame can lead to static images that are drab and contain no context or “life”.
> * Ordinary photos - If you keep your subject centered in the frame, your photo will be seen as particularly ordinary.
> * Discourages viewers - A center focal point is so heavily weighted that it draws the eye and it gets stuck there.
Unbalanced
> If the subject was central, there would be lots of empty space on the left-hand side of the image.
The rule of thirds suggests that the most interesting location for an image's focal point lies one third in from either edge of the frame and one third down from the top or up from the bottom. 

## Presentation Design
* Slides should reinforce your points - capture and hold the attention of the audience.
* Text should emphasize the points
* Refer to book by Nancy Duarte - Slide:ology https://www.duarte.com/resources/books/slideology/
* Fonts are important - they have a power and elegance - use fonts to convey emotions - see [here](https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/the-psychology-of-fonts--cms-34943)
* Less is more - when it comes to different fonts, different colors, and the amount of words on slides
