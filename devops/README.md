# What is devops?
DevOps integrates the development and operations team by implementing automation of infrastructure, workflows, building and deploying code, etc. in order to improve collaboration and productivity.  Code is built and deployed in small pieces.  All development is test-driven and application performance is continuously being measured.

## VMs vs. Containers
* VMs each have an OS and containers share the host OS
* Containers
  * Similar to VMs, but more lightweight
  * Relaxed isolation properties to share the OS between apps.
  * Container has its own filesystem, share of CPU, memory, process space, and more.
  * Decoupled from the underlying infrastructure - this makes them portable across clouds and OS distros.

## Container Orchestration
Container orchestration automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. Enterprises that need to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of LinuxÂ® containers and hosts can benefit from container orchestration. 

Container orchestration tools provide a framework for managing containers and microservices architecture at scale. There are many container orchestration tools that can be used for container lifecycle management. Some popular options are Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos.
