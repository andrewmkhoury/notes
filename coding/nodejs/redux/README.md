Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* Library for managing application state.
* Used with react-redux library for integrating with react.
* Redux toolkit is the recommended way to write redux logic.

* One way data flow
  * State describes condition of app at point in time and UI renders that.
  * When a change occurs:
        * UI dispatches action
        * Store runs reducers updating state
        * Store notifies the UI
        * UI re-renders based on that
