2. Job Market Transformations

2.1 Displacement and Creation
	•	U.S. Projections:
	•	By 2030, AI could automate tasks accounting for up to 30% of hours worked in the U.S. economy, especially in routine-based jobs such as data entry, customer service, and basic assembly line work.
	•	At the same time, the World Economic Forum estimates AI could create 78 million more jobs globally than it displaces by 2030, suggesting net positive job creation, although new roles will require specialized skills (data science, AI ethics, AI integration, etc.).
	•	Global Projections:
	•	Regions with strong technology infrastructure (e.g., North America, Western Europe, East Asia) stand to gain the most from new AI-related jobs.
	•	In emerging economies, AI could automate a large portion of manual labor, prompting a surge in demand for tech-related retraining programs.

2.2 Skills Shift
	•	High-Skilled Roles: AI-savvy roles—such as AI engineers, data scientists, and robotics specialists—will see significant growth.
	•	Medium- to Low-Skilled Roles: Repetitive tasks risk automation. Upskilling and reskilling programs will be vital for these segments to transition into new opportunities.

3. Economic Projections

3.1 U.S. Economic Impact
	•	GDP Growth:
	•	AI is projected to have a measurable impact on U.S. GDP as early as 2027, contributing an incremental 1–1.5% to annual GDP growth by 2035.
	•	By 2045, AI-driven innovation could add an estimated $5–7 trillion to the U.S. economy cumulatively.
